## User Story

```md
As an employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I want to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
so that I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

<br>

## Motivation

The purpose of this app is to create my first project in `React`. I also used this as an opportunity to get acquainted with a new CSS framework, `Tailwind`.
<br>
<br>

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
WHEN I load the portfolio, I am presented with a page containing a header, followed by About, Skills, Work, and Contact sections.

WHEN I view the header, I am presented with the developer's name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.

WHEN I click on a navigation title, I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted.

WHEN I load the portfolio the first time, the Home section is selected by default.

WHEN I am presented with the Work section, I see titled images of six of the developer’s applications with links to the deployed applications and/or the corresponding GitHub repositories.

WHEN I am presented with the Contact section, I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message.

WHEN I click the Resume icon, I see a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer’s proficiencies.
```
